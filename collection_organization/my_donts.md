# My Don'ts

* Don't include video format information in the names.  It can be seen when using a database program like PVD or MediaInfo.
* Don't make too many sub-folders.
* Don't keep any files not needed, like the torrent files.
* Don't keep videos with bad quality.
* Don't keep videos with burned in subtitles.
* Don't keep movies in format 4:3 if they should be at least 16:9.  Or at least move them in a folder for bad quality movies.
* Don't rename your files manually.  Use a renaming tool like FileBot.
* Don't keep not used subtitle files.  If needed they can be download again.
* Don't keep your videos in zip or rar files.  Videos are already compressed and normally cannot be compressed more.
* Don't worry too much that you will lose a file, most likely you can get it again.
