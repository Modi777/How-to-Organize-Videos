# My Do's

* Do separate your video files according to what they are.  Movies, series, documentaries...
* Do use correct names.  Get them from an internet database.
* Do put the year in the movie files names after the actual movie name.
* Do put the series name, the season and the episode number in the file names.
* Do combine split video files.  Use AVI Mux GUI.
* Convert DVD files to single video files.  Use MakeMKV.
* Do delete some videos if you run out of space.  That increases the quality of your collection and saves
you the money to buy a new hard disk.
* Do use your friendâ€™s hard disk to make a back up of your good videos.
